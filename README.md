![Sheridan GO Logo](/image-resources/Sheridan-GO-Logo.png?raw=true "Sheridan GO")

In this game you purchase and hold REAL WORLD properties with in-game currency. You earn revenue over time depending on the percentage/number of properties you own. Use this income to reinvest and build your empire! The game will utilize GPS technology as well as the Google Places API to locate the current player location to find properties and in-game events. Other Sheridan GO players can also purchase interest in buildings making for some great competition!

## Prerequisites
- Android Lolipop (API level 20)
