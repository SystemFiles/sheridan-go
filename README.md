![Sheridan GO Logo](/image-resources/Sheridan-GO-Logo.png?raw=true "Sheridan GO")

Ever wanted to be the owner of a bunch of real life properties? Become a business manager in Sheridan GO. In this game you purchase and hold REAL WORLD properties. You gain money over time depending on the percentage/number of properties you own. Use this income to reinvest and build your empire! The game will utilize GPS technology in modern Android phones to locate the current player location to play the game. We will be using the Factual SDK for Point of Interest information as it seems they can handle up to 10,000 API calls per day for free which seems reasonable for now. Other Sheridan GO players can also purchase interest in buildings making for some great competition!
